We all tend to live our lives pursuing things that really don't matter in the grand scheme even if we ourselves are able to see it once in awhile by stepping back and looking at our lives. It's a hard problem to constantly be self aware and make the decisions we actually want. There's a new gadget that might actually help us live our life in the way we intended. [Tikker][tikker-link] is a wrist watch that estimates the number of years, day and hours you have left until you die and serves as a constant reminder. The watch allows users to enter their data such as lifestyle patterns and eating habits and gives a time until death estimate, which may be far from reality, but the effect is carried through nonetheless. I can see this sort of idea, if it hasn't yet already, moving towards the app space and being accessible on phones, serve as email reminders and the like. While there are other less materialistic methods for remembering to live your life such as building habits to actually enjoy your life, I think this is an interesting idea that would appeal to a variety of people and serves as a transition point, if not a stepping stone, to making this world a better place.
